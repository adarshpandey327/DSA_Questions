ðŸ’¡ **Question 7**

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

- [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
- [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that **rotating** an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of **unique** elements, return *the minimum element of this array*.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3,4,5,1,2]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

        while(l<=h){
            int mid=l+(h-l)/2;
            mini=min(min(mini,nums[l]),nums[mid]);
            if(nums[mid]>=nums[l]) l=mid+1;
            else h=mid-1;
        }
        return mini;
